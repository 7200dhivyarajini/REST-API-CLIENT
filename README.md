### **Java REST API Client Application**  

#### **Objective**  
Develop a Java application that consumes a public REST API, retrieves data (e.g., weather information), and displays it in a structured format. The application should handle HTTP requests and process JSON responses efficiently.  

#### **Tasks & Descriptions**  

1. **Research & Select a Public REST API**  
   - Identify a publicly available REST API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, JSONPlaceholder, etc.).  
   - Review the API documentation to understand request parameters, response formats, and rate limits.  

2. **Set Up Java Development Environment**  
   - Install and configure Java Development Kit (JDK) if not already set up.  
   - Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.  
   - Set up a build tool like Maven or Gradle (if needed) for managing dependencies.  

3. **Implement HTTP Request Handling**  
   - Use Java’s `HttpURLConnection` or a third-party library (e.g., `OkHttp` or `Apache HttpClient`) to send GET requests to the API.  
   - Handle response status codes and potential errors (e.g., network failures, API rate limits).  

4. **Parse JSON Responses**  
   - Use a JSON parsing library such as `Jackson` or `Gson` to convert JSON responses into Java objects.  
   - Extract and format relevant data for display.  

5. **Display Data in a Structured Format**  
   - Print the retrieved data in a user-friendly format in the console.  
   - Optionally, create a simple GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX for better visualization.  

6. **Error Handling & Logging**  
   - Implement exception handling for API failures, JSON parsing errors, and invalid responses.  
   - Use logging (e.g., `java.util.logging` or `SLF4J`) to track application behavior.  

7. **Test the Application**  
   - Test with valid and invalid API requests.  
   - Ensure the program correctly handles different response scenarios.  

8. **Optimize & Document the Code**  
   - Clean up and optimize the code for efficiency and readability.  
   - Write comments and documentation to explain key components of the application.  

#### **Deliverable**  
A Java program that:  
- Successfully fetches and processes data from a public REST API.  
- Parses and displays JSON data in a structured format.  
- Includes proper error handling and logging.  
- Optionally provides a GUI for enhanced user experience.
